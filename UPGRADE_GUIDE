This file contains information on what to watch out for when upgrading
from one version of dragonfly to another.
---------------------------------------------------------------

From 0.2 or earlier to 0.5:

* Enforcing variable naming conventions:
	1) Constants are CAPITALIZED and use the '_' to separate words
	2) Variables are lowercase and use the '-' to separate words

Examples:
	find 'documentroot' replace with 'DOCUMENT_ROOT'
	find 'dragonfly_version' replace with 'DRAGONFLY_VERSION'
	
Purpose:
	This is done so that it's clear which parts of Dragonfly
	are user-customizable and which are not, and to make naming
	conflicts more difficult.
	
* Environment variables are now global constants and therefore
  the ones formerly in Dragonfly context should be converted like this:

	Dragonfly:host => HTTP_HOST
	Dragonfly:useragent => HTTP_USER_AGENT
	Dragonfly:server => SERVER_SOFTWARE
	Dragonfly:programfiles => PROGRAMFILES
	Dragonfly:proxy => HTTP_PROXY	

	Alternatively you can use 'env' or '$SERVER' to access them:
	
	Example: ($SERVER "HTTP_HOST")
