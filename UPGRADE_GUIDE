This file contains information on what to watch out for when upgrading
from one version of dragonfly to another.
---------------------------------------------------------------

From 0.2 or earlier to 0.5:

* Enforcing variable naming conventions:
	1) Constants are CAPITALIZED and use the '_' to separate words
	2) Variables are lowercase and use the '-' to separate words

Examples:
	find 'documentroot' replace with 'DOCUMENT_ROOT'
	find 'dragonfly_version' replace with 'DRAGONFLY_VERSION'
	
Purpose:
	This is done so that it's clear which parts of Dragonfly
	are user-customizable and which are not, and to make naming
	conflicts more difficult.
	
* To avoid having too many constants all over the place, possibly
  causing confusion and conflicts with other similarly named variables,
  and to avoid cluttering the code, all environment variables have simply
  been placed into the PHP-like env map. Some constants still
  exist, namely those starting with 'dragonfly'

	Dragonfly:host => (env "HTTP_HOST")
	Dragonfly:useragent => (env "HTTP_USER_AGENT")
	Dragonfly:server => (env "SERVER_SOFTWARE")
	Dragonfly:programfiles => (env "PROGRAMFILES")
	Dragonfly:proxy => (env "HTTP_PROXY")	

	You can also use the new PHP-like symbol $SERVER instead of env.
	
	Example: ($SERVER "HTTP_HOST")
