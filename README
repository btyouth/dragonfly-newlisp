Congratulations on choosing Dragonfly!

'cd' into the example-site folder and run this command:

	./newlispServer

If you're on Windows open that file and run the command that's
inside of it manually instead, i.e.:

	newlisp dragonfly-framework/newlisp-redirection.lsp -http -d 8080 -w .

Open Your browser and visit http://localhost:8080/ - have FUN!

For installation information see INSTALL or after running
the above command visit:
